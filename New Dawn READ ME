For players on New Dawn.

You will need: 
Box called CargoIn (technically, you can have multiple boxes, you can call them anything as long as they start with CargoIn, e.g. CargoIn1 CargoIn2 etc)
Box called ConstructorIn (this is what you will hook all your constructors up to. 50k of each resource is kept topped up in here.
Box called FurnaceIn
Box called DeconstructorIn
Boxes called ST-* (e.g. ST-1, ST-2, ST-3 etc). This is the storage array. All items used in the constructor are held in this array of boxes. You will want 2-6 boxes. Add more if you want.
Box called Misc
Box called Meds
Box called ArmorBooster (can be an array, ArmorBooster1, 2 3 etc will work.
Box called HandWeapons (array, as above)
Box called HandWeaponAmmo
Box called Fuel
Box called MountedWeapons
Box called MountedWeaponAmmo

You'll also likely want an output box for your constructor, ConstructorOut is my usual, but this isn't referenced by scripts.

You will want 3 LCDs for scripts.
These are the sortingitems-ND, sortingmain-ND and sortingfurnace-decon-ND.
Each LCD, as usual, will need to be called 'Script:yourscriptnamehere'.

These scripts aren't complete. They do not have all (or even most) of the IDs from new dawn in here. 
What I would ask, is that if anyone wants to contribute to these scripts for new dawn. please add a script LCD with the following

{{items E.S 'CargoIn*'}}
{{Id}} {{Name}}
{{/items}}

and then add an LCD output. Then, send me the contents of the LCD output, and i'll get them added in.

Comments and suggestions welcome. If you want to be added to the list of editors of this script, please let me know and i will add you.
